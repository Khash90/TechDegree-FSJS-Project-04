# TechDegree-FSJS-Project-04
 OOP Game Show App

I have already done this project in the FEWD tech-degree , but yes the coding method was totally different and way more challenging , however my mind had a bit of preparation for this project . 
had the time to study classes a lot and this project gave the best practise of all .

*changes for styling* : 
changed the background and button
changed the name 
changed the background color for playing area such as backgrounds , lis , buttons
changed the background for winning and losing 

*challenges*:
overall classes are very usefull and not that easy to work with , but this project was really helpful for me to get smoother with classes and the way they work , especially how to test your methods .
and I have to say overal the entire project was a challenge , and im glad we didnt have to set "setters and getters" cause those two are beyond confusing.

*about the project*:
basically this is a game web app where random phrases gets selected and the player have 5 guesses to guess the phrase , each time the user make a wrong guess one life (heart pictures) gets removed , also you can choose the letters by pressing the keyboard letters not only clicking them with mouse.
